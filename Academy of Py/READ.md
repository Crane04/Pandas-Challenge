Well done! Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you've become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Your final report should include each of the following:
<h2>District Summary</h2>
<li>Total Schools</li>
<li>Total Students</li>
<li>Total Budget</li>
<li>Average Math Score</li>
<li>Average Reading Score</li>
<li>% Passing Math</li>
<li>% Passing Reading</li>
<li>Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)</li>

<h2>Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:</h2>
<li>School Name</li>
<li>School Type</li>
<li>Total Students</li>
<li>Total School Budgets</li>
<li>Per Student Budgete</li>
<li>Average math Score</li>
<li>Average Reading Score</li>
<li>% Passing Math</li>
<li>% Passing Reading</li>
<li>Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)</li>
